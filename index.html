I am currently learning t0 code with Code First Girls.
Going over everything from how internet works,
to creating websites and versions control with  git.
A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why ...
<p>
<ol>HTML is cool</ol>
<br>
<ol>CSS is cooler</ol>
<br>
<ol>JS is the best</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3><em>What do you need to create a website?</em></h3>

Not much!
<ul>A computer (always a good start)</ul>
<ul>A web browser (I am using chrome)</ul>
<ul>Some HTML,CSS and JS files</ul>
<br>
